# IntroPython
#Introduction of the basic structure and syntax etc. to Python
#Variables can not start with numbers or any special characters. and cannot be a name of a keyword.
#The ( = sign) is used to apply a value to a variable.
#Variable names are case sensitive.
#The ( + sign) can be used to concantenate>>(bring together) to strings and can be used for mathematical operations.

home = "Hello"
Home = "World"

#Concantenating the two string values and outputting it to the screen by accessing the string value through 
#calling the variable name>>(container name).
print(home + Home)
